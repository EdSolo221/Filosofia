# Vida e Obra
Boetius was born in the first half of the 13th century. Not much is known of his early life. The attempt to connect him to known persons from Denmark or [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden") has been unsuccessful.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boetius_of_Dacia#cite_note-1)[_[non-primary source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources "Wikipedia:No original research")_] All that is known is that he went to France to teach philosophy at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris "University of Paris"). At the university, he associated with [Siger of Brabant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siger_of_Brabant "Siger of Brabant"). He continued to teach for some time as arts masters rather than quickly moving on to study in the theology faculty or finding non-academic employment. He shared this unusual career path with Siger and others like [Roger Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon") and [Jean Buridan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Buridan "Jean Buridan"). He was [condemned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condemnations_(University_of_Paris) "Condemnations (University of Paris)") by [Stephen Tempier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Tempier "Stephen Tempier") in 1277 for being a leading member of the [Averroist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroism "Averroism").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boetius_of_Dacia#cite_note-2) Boetius fled [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") with Siger and appealed to [Pope Nicholas III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Nicholas_III "Pope Nicholas III"). He was detained at the pontifical [curia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curia "Curia") at [Orvieto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orvieto "Orvieto"). He went on to join the [Dominicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order "Dominican Order") in Denmark.

Boetius was a follower of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") and [Averroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averroes "Averroes") and a leading figure in the modists dogma. He wrote on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy"), [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), and [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics"), though some of his works have not survived. Some of his writings include; _[Modi Significandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modi_Significandi "Modi Significandi"), Super librum Perihermenias,_ and _Quaestiones super librum De animalibus,_ where he comments on these topics at length_.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boetius_of_Dacia#cite_note-3) His central position was that philosophy had to follow where the arguments led, regardless of their conflict with religious faith. For him, philosophy was the supreme human activity, and in this world only philosophers attained wisdom. In his book _On the Highest Good, or On the Life of the Philosopher_ he offers a fervently [Aristotelian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aristotelianism) description of man's [highest good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_good "Highest good") as the rational contemplation of truth and virtue. Among the controversial conclusions that he reached are the impossibility of [creation _ex nihilo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_nihilo "Creatio ex nihilo"), the [eternity of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternity_of_the_world "Eternity of the world") and of the human race, and that there could be no [resurrection of the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead "Resurrection of the dead").

Despite his radical views, Boetius remained a [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"); he attempted to reconcile his religious beliefs with his philosophical positions by assigning the investigation of the world and of [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature") to philosophy, while to religion he assigned supernatural [revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation "Revelation") and divine [miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle "Miracle"). He was condemned for holding the doctrine of "[double truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_truth "Double truth")", though he was careful to avoid calling philosophical conclusions that ran contrary to religion true _simpliciter_: In each branch of knowledge, one must be careful to qualify one's conclusions.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boetius_of_Dacia#cite_note-4) The conclusions that the philosopher reaches are true "according to natural causes and principles" (_De Aeternitate Mundi_, p. 351).[_[non-primary source needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources "Wikipedia:No original research")_]

Much like his early life, researchers have not been able to find exactly when Boetius died or what he did after 1277. "The Stams Catalogue" (14th Century) is a collection of literature from Dominican writers that includes Boethius, so there is some evidence suggesting he became a friar after his career in liberal arts.
